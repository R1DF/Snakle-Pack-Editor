# Snakle Pack Editor
Snakle Pack Editor is the official tool used to create and edit custom word packs for [Legacy Snakle](https://www.github.com/R1DF/Legacy-Snakle), with features such as:
* A very user-friendly and simplistic GUI built with nothing but Tkinter.
* An ability to add, delete, and edit words in any pack you wish to edit.
* A history section where you don't need to locate the file in your file system every time.
* A function that allows you to deposit your pack straight inside your Snakle game directory, either by moving or making a copy.
* A function that allows you to view the file's JSON source text straight inside the game.
* Just a splendid way overall to make packs where you don't need to learn how to handle JSON, or require a friendly WYSIWYG interface.
